= Upgrading from Frugalware 1.7 to 1.8

== Preamble

The aim of this howto is to show how you can upgrade a Frugalware-1.7
(Gaia) system to Frugalware-1.8 (Cinna).

== Deprecated package removal

Some packages will not gracefully be removed because of strict dependencies.
Here is the command to remove them before an upgrade:

----
pacman-g2 -R systemd-gtk systemd-plymouth dracut-plymouth plymouth plymouth-theme-frugalware plymouth-theme-glow plymouth-theme-solar plymouth-theme-spinfinity
----

== pacman-g2

The new release comes with an improved `pacman-g2`, you should install it
first:

----
pacman-g2 -Sy pacman-g2
----

== Upgrading the system

Now it's time to upgrade the system itself:

----
pacman-g2 -Su
:: Starting local database upgrade...
----

You will be asked to replace some packages automatically.  These are
normal and you are expected to answer 'Y' to these questions (or just
hit ENTER).

After this, the list of to-be-upgraded packages is displayed. Just hit
enter and wait. Make some tea, it can take a while. :-)

== Updating config files

`pacman-g2` does not touch configuration files in case you customized
them. You should run

----
find /etc -name '*.pacnew'
----

and update each configuration file based on the `.pacnew` version. Once
you're done with one, you should remove the `.pacnew` file.

== The reboot

Since the kernel is upgraded, too, you have to reboot your machine.

Done!
