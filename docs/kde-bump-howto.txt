= KDE4 Bump HOWTO


You *MUST* follow this HOWTO when bumping KDE4 to a new version (even a minor version).

First, update KDE4 version (_F_kde_ver) in source/include/kde-version.sh. 
Commit this (git commit kde.sh). 
From kde-4.7.0 we store all the sha1sums in source/include/kde-version.sh so don't
forget to update that as well (you can use http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/people/melko/kdesha.sh[this]
to fetch the sha1sums).

Next, packages must be compiled in the order listed below (if you find a
change that needs to be made to this list, poke the kde m8r). 
You can generally find the sha1sums in the kde website (somewhere like http://kde.org/info/KdeVersion.php).
If it is a major bump (i.e. 4.6 to 4.7) it is wise to check the updated build 
instructions on the Kde website, and work in a kde testing repo first.
